(collectively \\\"WYZZ\\\") and Nexstar Broadcasting of Peoria, L.L.C. (\\\"NEXSTAR\\\") hereby enter into this Agreement (this \\\"Agreement\\\") dated November 28, 2001. WYZZ and Nexstar are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \\\"Party\\\" and collectively as the \\\"Parties\\\". RECITALS WHEREAS, WYZZ is the licensee, pursuant to authorizations issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the \\\"FCC\\\"), of Broadcast Television Station WYZZ (\\\"WYZZ-TV\\\") licensed in the Peoria-Bloomington, Illinois market and is experienced as an FCC licensee in the management and operation of commercial television stations\\u037e and WHEREAS, NEXSTAR is the licensee, pursuant to authorizations issued by the FCC, of Broadcast Television Station WMBD-TV (\\\"WMBD-TV \\\") licensed in the Peoria-Bloomington, Illinois market and is experienced as an FCC licensee in the management and operation of commercial television stations\\u037e and WHEREAS, WMBD-TV and WYZZ-TV are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the \\\"Stations\\u037e\\\" and WHEREAS, during the term of this Agreement, WYZZ wishes to retain Nexstar to provide certain non-programming related operational and managerial services on its behalf, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all in conformity with the policies and procedures of WYZZ (as they relate specifically to WYZZ-TV) and the rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC\\u037e and WHEREAS, none of the services to be provided by Nexstar to WYZZ hereunder are intended to abrogate WYZZ's exclusive authority and duty, as the FCC licensee of WYZZ-TV, to manage and control programming on WYZZ-TV\\u037e and WHEREAS, Nexstar agrees to provide the services to WYZZ in conformity with the policies and procedures of WYZZ (as they relate specifically to WYZZ-TV) and all rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC\\u037e and WHEREAS, it is the Parties' expectation that by entering into this Agreement the operational efficiencies of each of the Stations will improve and economies of scale will be achieved, resulting in an increase in the Broadcast Cash Flow (as hereinafter defined) to each of the Parties from their respective Stations. NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION OF the mutual covenants herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Provision of Services. (a) Consistent with the rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC, Nexstar shall, during the Term (as hereinafter defined), provide to WYZZ-TV the following services (the \\\"Services\\\"): (i) sale of advertising time on WYZZ-TV\\u037e (ii) the performance of certain administrative, operational, and business functions other than with respect to programming but including the coordination of traffic and billing functions\\u037e (iii) consultation services regarding programming, including, where applicable, news and public affairs\\u037e (iv) the supplying of all accounting, bookkeeping and related services\\u037e (v) the monitoring, maintenance, repair, and replacement of WYZZ's technical equipment and facilities, including capital equipment replacement expenditures, in order to ensure that the technical facilities of WYZZ-TV are in compliance with the rules and regulations of the FCC\\u037e and (vi) assistance with the negotiation of retransmission consent with cable, satellite and other multi-channel video providers. (b) In order to accommodate the provision of the Services by Nexstar, WYZZ agrees to make available to Nexstar (subject to any lease and/or financing agreements applicable thereto) for use without fee or charge the facilities and equipment described on Exhibit A hereto (the \\\"Equipment\\\"), all of which Equipment shall be appropriately tagged indicating the ownership thereof. Nexstar shall maintain the Equipment in good order and repair in accordance with industry standards. Subject to the reduction of the Section 2(a) Amount in accordance with Section 2(a) hereof, Nexstar shall bear the cost of maintaining and repairing the Equipment. Nexstar shall provide the functions required by this Agreement subject to (i) each Party's absolute right and duty to control and manage its own programming, personnel and finances, (ii) the other provisions of this Agreement and (iii) the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC. 2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties recognize that WYZZ is, and at all times shall be, responsible for programming WYZZ-TV and nothing in this Agreement is intended to detract from that responsibility. 2. Payment to WYZZ-TV. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, WYZZ shall continue to be the owner of and shall be entitled to all revenues resulting from the sale of advertising and other time on WYZZ-TV before, during and/or after the Term\\u037e provided, however, in consideration of the Services, Nexstar shall be entitled to all revenues resulting from the sale of advertising and other time on the Stations during the Term remaining after the payment of the amounts set forth below: (a) Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that \\\"BCF\\\" (as defined below) for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is less than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such month. Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that BCF for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months of such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is greater than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to 50% of BCF for such month\\u037e provided, in the first month of each calendar year in which this sentence applies, the fee with respect to the portion of BCF for such month which, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is exactly equal to the Minimum BCF, shall equal thirty-five percent (35%) of such portion rather than fifty percent (50%). The amount payable pursuant to either of the prior two sentences (sometimes referred to as the \\\"Section 2(a) Amount\\\") shall be reduced by the sum of (A) 100% of any costs incurred by Nexstar during the applicable month in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is owned by WYZZ or which is used solely in connection with the operation of WYZZ-TV, which costs have not otherwise been deducted in calculating BCF, plus (B) 50% of the cost incurred by Nexstar during the applicable month in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is not owned by WYZZ and which is used in connection with the combined operation of both Stations (\\\"Combined Capital Equipment)\\\", which costs have not otherwise been deducted in calculating BCF. The Minimum BCF shall be Three Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,700,000) for calendar year 2002 and shall be increased on January 1, 2003 and on each January 1 thereafter in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Philadelphia Regional Office - All Urban Consumers for the United States - All Items) (the \\\"PI\\\") over the prior year. During the Term, Nexstar shall calculate BCF (the \\\"BCF Report\\\") for each calendar month. The last day of each calendar month is referred to herein as an \\\"End Date\\\". During the Term, Nexstar shall, within thirty (30) days of each End Date deliver to WYZZ-TV the BCF Report for the month ending on such End Date. Within ninety (90) days following each 3 calendar year during the Term, Nexstar shall notify WYZZ of the BCF for such year (the \\\"Final BCF Report\\\") and, subject to clause (h) of this Section 2, within thirty (30) days after such notification either Nexstar shall make a payment to WYZZ or WYZZ shall make a payment to Nexstar, as appropriate to \\\"true-up\\\" the payments made hereunder based on (i) the final determination of the BCF for the entire year, and (ii) the principle that the aggregate Section 2(a) Amount for the calendar year should be equal to (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such calendar year up to the Minimum BCF for such year, plus (y) fifty percent (50%) of BCF for such calendar year in excess of the Minimum BCF for such year, minus (z) the sum of one hundred percent (100%) of any costs incurred by Nexstar during such calendar year in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is owned by WYZZ or which is used solely in connection with the operation of WYZZ-TV, and fifty percent (50%) of any costs incurred by Nexstar during such calendar year in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is not owned by WYZZ and which is used in connection with the combined operation of both Stations (in each case to the extent such costs were not otherwise deducted in the calculation of BCF). Furthermore, for the purposes of clarification, to the extent the Section 2(a) Amount for the calendar year is less than zero, the \\\"true-up\\\" shall be done such that WYZZ shall have paid to Nexstar the amount by which the Section 2(a) Amount is less than zero. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein for purposes of the period commencing December 1, 2001 and ending December 31, 2001, the Minimum BCF shall be One Dollar ($1.00). (b) In addition to the payment of the Section 2(a) Amount, Nexstar agrees to pay WYZZ, within 30 days following each calendar month of the Term, the amount set forth on Exhibit B hereto with respect to such calendar month (c) On or before the 5th day of each calendar month during the Term, Nexstar shall pay to WYZZ the fair market value rent (as set forth on Exhibit C hereto) of any real property owned by WYZZ (or any affiliate thereof) and used by the Stations\\u037e provided, no rent shall be due to WYZZ, Nexstar or any affiliate thereof with respect to any period where the Stations are using corresponding real property owned by Nexstar (or any affiliate thereof). By way of example, no rent shall be due to WYZZ or Nexstar under this clause (c) for use by one of the Stations of a broadcast tower owned by WYZZ if the other Station is using a tower owned by Nexstar. (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term \\\"BCF\\\" is defined as Net Income of the Stations, determined on a basis in accordance with GAAP, plus the sum of (X) (in each case to the extent deducted in calculating Net Income) (i) depreciation expense (ii) amortization expense (including amortization of program assets and amortization of deferred and stock based compensation) (iii) interest expense (iv) corporate overhead or management fees (v) income tax expense (vi) non-cash losses or expenses (including losses on disposals of assets and trade/barter expenses) (vii) Section 2(a) Amount expenses pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof (viii) any expenses (other than 4 electric costs relating to the digital transmission of either Station's primary commercial broadcast signal) related to either Station's \\\"DTV Spectrum\\\" (ix) costs or expenses arising from any claims relating to the period prior to the Effective Date, and (x) any expenses or costs identified on Exhibit D hereto less the sum of (Y) (i) cash payments for program contract rights relating to the Stations (ii) payments made by Nexstar to WYZZ pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 2, to the extent not otherwise taken into account in calculating Net Income, (iii) the aggregate fair market value rent (as set forth on Exhibit C hereto) of any real property owned by either Nexstar or WYZZ (or any affiliate of either) and used by the Stations to the extent the Stations are not using corresponding real property owned by each of the parties hereto (or any affiliate thereof) and which is not otherwise taken into account in calculating Net Income, (iv) any other rental income earned by either WYZZ or Nexstar from real property owned or leased thereby to the extent included in calculating Net Income (v) interest income to the extent included in calculating Net Income (vi) any rent paid with respect to any capital leases of the Stations (vii ) any revenues related to either Station's \\\"DTV Spectrum\\\" and (viii) any non-cash gains or revenues (including gains on disposals of assets and trade/barter revenue). (e) At all times during the Term and for six (6) months following the termination of this Agreement, WYZZ shall have the right, upon prior written request to Nexstar, to review all of the books and records of Nexstar relating to the BCF Report and the Distributions. Any such review must take place during normal business hours between Monday through Friday. (f) The parties agree that, to the extent permitted by law and by the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, the Stations shall be operated in a manner consistent with industry standards for commercial broadcast television stations providing general entertainment programming and with a view toward maximizing the combined broadcast cash flow of the Stations. (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, with respect to any month, the Section 2(a) Amount is a negative amount, then WYZZ shall pay such negative amount to Nexstar within seventy-five (75) days following the end of such month (and Nexstar shall make no payment of a Section 2(a) Amount to WYZZ with respect to such month)\\u037e provided, with respect to each of the first three (3) months of the Term, the amount if any, payable pursuant to this clause (g) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of accounts receivable retained by Buyer during such month pursuant to the first proviso to the last sentence of Section 10(d)(i). (h) On or prior to the 30th day after WYZZ's receipt of the Final BCF Report, WYZZ may give Nexstar a written notice (an \\\"Objection Notice\\\") indicating its objections to the Final BCF Report. If WYZZ does not give Nexstar an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the Final BCF Report will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. If WYZZ gives a timely Objection Notice, then Nexstar and 5 WYZZ will negotiate in good faith to resolve their disputes regarding the Final BCF Report. If Nexstar and WYZZ are unable to resolve all disputes regarding the Final BCF Report on or prior to the 30th day after the Objection Notice is given, then Nexstar and WYZZ will retain a \\\"big five\\\" accounting firm (either by mutual agreement or by random choice after eliminating any such firm which is conflicted or otherwise unable to participate) (the \\\"Independent Accounting Firm\\\") to resolve the dispute as soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days. The BCF for the applicable year as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and will constitute the BCF for such year for all purposes of this Section 2\\u037e provided, the parties will use reasonable efforts to limit the scope of the Independent Accounting Firm's review. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with its review of the Final BCF Report shall be paid one-half by Nexstar and one-half by WYZZ. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, cash payments for program content rights relating to the Stations which were contractually due prior to the Effective Date shall for all purposes be treated as relating to the period following the Effective Date if, and only if, such payments were ninety days or less past due as of the Effective Date. 3.

The Annual Budget for the one month period beginning December 1, 2001 and Year 2002 (the \\\"Initial Budget\\\"), is attached hereto as Exhibit H.

Each such revised Annual Budget, if required, shall be completed no later than October 31, of each year during the Term hereof. (iii) In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any disputes regarding any Annual Budget by December 15 of each year during the Term hereof, and either Party has notified the other in writing of the basis for its inability to agree on such Annual Budgets, then, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of clause (i) of this Section 11(a), the disputed items in the Annual Budget for the next succeeding year shall be the same as such disputed items were in the Annual Budget for the immediately preceding year, except for costs (e.g., sales commissions) that vary as a result of revenue. b. Employees. Exhibit I contains a preliminary list of all employees, by position held by each, who are to be terminated from each of the Stations on such date as is mutually agreed by the parties on or after the Effective Time, but not later than March 1, 2002 (the \\\"Terminated Employees\\\").

In such event, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement promptly on lawful substitute provisions in place of said offending provision to effectuate as nearly as possible their intent as expressed by this Agreement. 22. Digital Spectrum. The FCC has authorized an additional 6 MHz of spectrum for digital television service (\\\"DTV Spectrum\\\") to Nexstar for WMBD-TV and to WYZZ for WYZZ-TV.

Indemnification. a. by Nexstar. Nexstar shall indemnify and hold harmless WYZZ from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, liabilities, damages, and expenses, including any FCC fines or forfeitures (including reasonable legal fees and other expenses incidental thereto), of every kind, nature and description (collectively \\\"Damages\\\") arising or resulting from or relating to (i) Nexstar's breach of any representation, covenant, agreement or other obligation of Nexstar contained in this Agreement and (ii) any action, which constitutes gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct taken by Nexstar or its employees and agents with respect to WYZZ-TV, or any failure by Nexstar or its employees and agents to take any action with respect to WYZZ-TV, including, without limitation, Damages relating to violations of the Act, or any rule, regulation or policy of the FCC, slander, defamation or other claims relating to the sale of advertising time on the Station (except where the Damages are caused by WYZZ's negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct, or breach of its representations or obligations under this Agreement), from and after the Effective Date of this Agreement. b. by WYZZ. WYZZ shall indemnify and hold harmless Nexstar from and against any and all Damages arising or resulting from or relating to (i) WYZZ's breach of any representation, covenant, agreement or other obligation of WYZZ contained in this Agreement and (ii) any action taken, which constitutes gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct by WYZZ or its employees and agents with respect to WMBD-TV, or any failure by WYZZ or its employees and agents to take any action with respect to WMBD-TV, including, without limitation, Damages relating to violations of the Act, or any rule, regulation or policy of the FCC, slander, defamation or other claims relating to programming provided by WYZZ or WYZZ's broadcast and sale of advertising time on WMBD-TV (except where the Damages were incurred by Nexstar's negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct, or breach of any representation, covenant, agreement or other obligation contained in this Agreement), from and after the Effective Date of this Agreement. c. Indemnification Procedure. Neither WYZZ nor Nexstar shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section unless such claim for indemnification is asserted in a written notice delivered to the other Party, together with a statement as to the factual basis for the claim and the amount of the claim. Together with such notice or promptly following the delivery thereof, the Party making the claim (the \\\"Claimant\\\") shall make available to the other Party (the \\\"Indemnitor\\\") information relied upon by the 23 Claimant to substantiate the claim. Such notice shall be given promptly following Claimant knowing or having reason to know about such claim\\u037e provided, the Indemnitor shall be relieved of a liability for Claimant's failure to provide notice only if, and to the extent, adversely impacted by such failure. The Indemnitor under this Section 26(c) shall have the right to conduct and control through counsel of its own choosing the defense of any third Party claim, action or suit (and the Claimant shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor), but the Claimant may, at its election, participate in the defense of any such claim, action or suit at its sole cost and expense\\u037e provided, that, if the Indemnitor shall fail to defend any such claim, action or suit, then the Claimant may defend through counsel of its own choosing such claim, action or suit, and (so long as it gives the Indemnitor at least fifteen (15) days' notice of the terms of the proposed settlement thereof and permits the Indemnitor to then undertake the defense thereof), Claimant may settle such claim, action or suit, and, if Claimant is entitled to be indemnified by Indemnitor hereunder, Claimant may recover from the Indemnitor the amount of such settlement or of any judgment and the costs and expenses of such defense. The Indemnitor shall not compromise or settle any third Party claim, action or suit without the prior written consent of the Claimant, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 26. Damages\\u037e Specific Performance. a. In the event of a material breach by WYZZ of its obligations hereunder, Nexstar shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against WYZZ. The Parties recognize, however, that, given the unique nature of the Station and this Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Nexstar for any injury resulting from WYZZ's breach. Except to the extent such action would not be permitted by the rules and regulations of the FCC, Nexstar shall therefore be entitled, in addition to a right to seek and collect monetary damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought by Nexstar to enforce this Agreement, WYZZ shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. In addition, in the event of a material breach by WYZZ of its obligations hereunder, Nexstar shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights pursuant to Section 25(b) hereof (except that Nexstar may not assert consequential, special or punitive damages or any claim for lost profits). b. In the event of a material breach by Nexstar of its obligations hereunder, WYZZ shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against Nexstar. The Parties recognize, however, that, given the unique nature of the Station and this Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate WYZZ for any injury resulting from Nexstar's breach. Except to the extent such action would not be permitted by the rules and regulations of the FCC, WYZZ shall therefore be entitled, in addition to a right to seek and collect monetary damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought by WYZZ to enforce this Agreement, Nexstar 24 shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. In addition, in the event of a material breach by Nexstar of its obligations hereunder, WYZZ shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights pursuant to Section 25(a) hereof (except that WYZZ may not assert consequential, special or punitive damages or any claim for lost profits). c. In the event any Party files a lawsuit or institutes other formal legal action to enforce its rights under this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be reimbursed by the other Party for all reasonable expenses incurred thereby, including reasonable attorney's fees. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES.

              "'EXHIBIT 10.3 TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AGREEMENT THIS MARINE TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is executed this 23rd day of December, 2003, by and between Martin Operating Partnership L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Owner”), and Midstream Fuel Service LLC, an Alabama limited liability company (“Charterer”), in order to evidence the agreement of such parties with respect to Owner’s provision of marine transportation services with respect to #2 fuel oil and high sulfur diesel on board its marine vessels under the following terms and conditions. 1. TERM; TERMINATION The initial term of this Agreement shall be for 3 years (the “Initial Term”) commencing on the date first set forth above (the “Commencement Date”) and ending on the 3rd anniversary of the Commencement Date. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one year terms (each a “Renewal Term”, and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”), unless either Charterer or Owner elects not to renew this Agreement by providing the other party with written notice of such election 30 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, at which point this Agreement will automatically terminate. Within 30 days of the end of the Initial Term, and within 30 days of the end of each Renewal Term, both parties hereto shall have the right renegotiate the fee specified below for the use of the vessels. If no such agreement on such fee is reached by such parties by the commencement of a Renewal Term, this Agreement shall automatically terminate. Either party hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in the event of a breach by the other party of its obligations hereunder, subject to 10 days prior written notice of such breach given by the non-breaching party to the breaching party and the opportunity for such breaching party to cure such breach during such 10 day period. Upon any such termination, this Agreement shall thereafter have no further force or effect except as to already accrued rights and obligations, which shall continue until satisfied. 2. GENERAL TERMS During the Term, Charterer agrees that Owner will be the sole and exclusive provider of marine transportation services for #2 fuel oil and high sulfur diesel owned by Charterer or owned by others and in transit for sale to Charterer so long as Owner has the required equipment available. Owner shall at all times provide sufficient and proper equipment for Charterer’s performance of such transportation. Said equipment shall be manned, equipped, supplied and operated by Owner. The master and crew of said vessels shall be fully qualified, experience and, where necessary, certified and licensed. Owner agrees that said equipment shall be maintained in a seaworthy, staunch, tight and suitable condition and, to the best of Owner’s knowledge, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In connection with its use of any vessel, Charterer will follow Owner’s normal scheduling, loading and offloading protocols established from time to time, subject to Owner’s obligations set forth in this Agreement. 1 3. RATE Charterer agrees to pay to Owner a fee of $ per gallon of product transported. Owner will invoice such fees to Charterer on a monthly basis and Charterer will pay such invoiced amounts within 30 days of invoice date. The fee stated above, unless otherwise adjusted by the parties pursuant to Section 1 above, shall be adjusted annually (both upward and downward), by a factor equal to the amount of increase or decrease, as the case may be, in the Consumer Price Index for the immediately proceeding month of November, over the Consumer Price Index for November of the preceding year. For purposes hereof, the term “Consumer Price Index” shall mean the “Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (1967=100)” specified for “All Items. United States” compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor (the “Index”). In the event the Consumer Price Index shall be converted to a different standard reference base or otherwise revised, the determination of the percentage change shall be made with the use of such conversion factor, formula or table for converting the Consumer Price Index as may be published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or, if said Bureau shall not publish the same, then as shall be reasonably determined by the parties. 4. LOAD AND DISCHARGE The Load Port shall be FOB Refinery Offtake in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Discharge Port shall be at the Owner’s terminals located at Venice, LA; Port Forrochon, LA; Berwick, LA; Intracoastal City, LA; Cameron, LA; Sabine Pass, TX; Beaumont, TX; Galveston, TX; Houston, TX; Freeport, TX; Port O’Connor, TX; and Harbor Island, TX. 5. TITLE TO PRODUCT Title to all product handled shall remain at all times in the name of the Charterer. The Charterer agrees not to tender for load any product injurious to the vessels or which product would render the vessels unfit, after cleaning, for the proper storage of similar product. 6. ASSIGNMENT Neither party shall assign this Agreement without the express written consent of the other party. 7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement concerning the subject hereof between the parties superseding all previous agreements, negotiations and representations made prior or contemporaneous to the date hereof. This Agreement shall be modified or amended only by written agreement executed by both parties hereto. 8. GOVERNING LAW This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. 9. ADDITIONAL TERMS The “Additional Terms” attached hereto as Exhibit A shall be deemed to be incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. 2 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first set forth above.

WYZZ and Nexstar are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \\\"Party\\\" and collectively as the \\\"Parties\\\". RECITALS WHEREAS, WYZZ is the licensee, pursuant to authorizations issued by the Federal Communications Commission (the \\\"FCC\\\"), of Broadcast Television Station WYZZ (\\\"WYZZ-TV\\\") licensed in the Peoria-Bloomington, Illinois market and is experienced as an FCC licensee in the management and operation of commercial television stations\\u037e and WHEREAS, NEXSTAR is the licensee, pursuant to authorizations issued by the FCC, of Broadcast Television Station WMBD-TV (\\\"WMBD-TV \\\") licensed in the Peoria-Bloomington, Illinois market and is experienced as an FCC licensee in the management and operation of commercial television stations\\u037e and WHEREAS, WMBD-TV and WYZZ-TV are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the \\\"Stations\\u037e\\\" and WHEREAS, during the term of this Agreement, WYZZ wishes to retain Nexstar to provide certain non-programming related operational and managerial services on its behalf, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all in conformity with the policies and procedures of WYZZ (as they relate specifically to WYZZ-TV) and the rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC\\u037e and WHEREAS, none of the services to be provided by Nexstar to WYZZ hereunder are intended to abrogate WYZZ's exclusive authority and duty, as the FCC licensee of WYZZ-TV, to manage and control programming on WYZZ-TV\\u037e and WHEREAS, Nexstar agrees to provide the services to WYZZ in conformity with the policies and procedures of WYZZ (as they relate specifically to WYZZ-TV) and all rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC\\u037e and WHEREAS, it is the Parties' expectation that by entering into this Agreement the operational efficiencies of each of the Stations will improve and economies of scale will be achieved, resulting in an increase in the Broadcast Cash Flow (as hereinafter defined) to each of the Parties from their respective Stations. NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION OF the mutual covenants herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 1. Provision of Services. (a) Consistent with the rules, regulations, and policies of the FCC, Nexstar shall, during the Term (as hereinafter defined), provide to WYZZ-TV the following services (the \\\"Services\\\"): (i) sale of advertising time on WYZZ-TV\\u037e (ii) the performance of certain administrative, operational, and business functions other than with respect to programming but including the coordination of traffic and billing functions\\u037e (iii) consultation services regarding programming, including, where applicable, news and public affairs\\u037e (iv) the supplying of all accounting, bookkeeping and related services\\u037e (v) the monitoring, maintenance, repair, and replacement of WYZZ's technical equipment and facilities, including capital equipment replacement expenditures, in order to ensure that the technical facilities of WYZZ-TV are in compliance with the rules and regulations of the FCC\\u037e and (vi) assistance with the negotiation of retransmission consent with cable, satellite and other multi-channel video providers.

Nexstar shall maintain the Equipment in good order and repair in accordance with industry standards. Subject to the reduction of the Section 2(a) Amount in accordance with Section 2(a) hereof, Nexstar shall bear the cost of maintaining and repairing the Equipment. Nexstar shall provide the functions required by this Agreement subject to (i) each Party's absolute right and duty to control and manage its own programming, personnel and finances, (ii) the other provisions of this Agreement and (iii) the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC. 2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties recognize that WYZZ is, and at all times shall be, responsible for programming WYZZ-TV and nothing in this Agreement is intended to detract from that responsibility. 2. Payment to WYZZ-TV. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, WYZZ shall continue to be the owner of and shall be entitled to all revenues resulting from the sale of advertising and other time on WYZZ-TV before, during and/or after the Term\\u037e provided, however, in consideration of the Services, Nexstar shall be entitled to all revenues resulting from the sale of advertising and other time on the Stations during the Term remaining after the payment of the amounts set forth below: (a) Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that \\\"BCF\\\" (as defined below) for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is less than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such month. Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that BCF for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months of such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is greater than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to 50% of BCF for such month\\u037e provided, in the first month of each calendar year in which this sentence applies, the fee with respect to the portion of BCF for such month which, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is exactly equal to the Minimum BCF, shall equal thirty-five percent (35%) of such portion rather than fifty percent (50%). The amount payable pursuant to either of the prior two sentences (sometimes referred to as the \\\"Section 2(a) Amount\\\") shall be reduced by the sum of (A) 100% of any costs incurred by Nexstar during the applicable month in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is owned by WYZZ or which is used solely in connection with the operation of WYZZ-TV, which costs have not otherwise been deducted in calculating BCF, plus (B) 50% of the cost incurred by Nexstar during the applicable month in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is not owned by WYZZ and which is used in connection with the combined operation of both Stations (\\\"Combined Capital Equipment)\\\", which costs have not otherwise been deducted in calculating BCF. The Minimum BCF shall be Three Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,700,000) for calendar year 2002 and shall be increased on January 1, 2003 and on each January 1 thereafter in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Philadelphia Regional Office - All Urban Consumers for the United States - All Items) (the \\\"PI\\\") over the prior year. During the Term, Nexstar shall calculate BCF (the \\\"BCF Report\\\") for each calendar month. The last day of each calendar month is referred to herein as an \\\"End Date\\\". During the Term, Nexstar shall, within thirty (30) days of each End Date deliver to WYZZ-TV the BCF Report for the month ending on such End Date. Within ninety (90) days following each 3 calendar year during the Term, Nexstar shall notify WYZZ of the BCF for such year (the \\\"Final BCF Report\\\") and, subject to clause (h) of this Section 2, within thirty (30) days after such notification either Nexstar shall make a payment to WYZZ or WYZZ shall make a payment to Nexstar, as appropriate to \\\"true-up\\\" the payments made hereunder based on (i) the final determination of the BCF for the entire year, and (ii) the principle that the aggregate Section 2(a) Amount for the calendar year should be equal to (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such calendar year up to the Minimum BCF for such year, plus (y) fifty percent (50%) of BCF for such calendar year in excess of the Minimum BCF for such year, minus (z) the sum of one hundred percent (100%) of any costs incurred by Nexstar during such calendar year in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is owned by WYZZ or which is used solely in connection with the operation of WYZZ-TV, and fifty percent (50%) of any costs incurred by Nexstar during such calendar year in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is not owned by WYZZ and which is used in connection with the combined operation of both Stations (in each case to the extent such costs were not otherwise deducted in the calculation of BCF). Furthermore, for the purposes of clarification, to the extent the Section 2(a) Amount for the calendar year is less than zero, the \\\"true-up\\\" shall be done such that WYZZ shall have paid to Nexstar the amount by which the Section 2(a) Amount is less than zero. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein for purposes of the period commencing December 1, 2001 and ending December 31, 2001, the Minimum BCF shall be One Dollar ($1.00). (b) In addition to the payment of the Section 2(a) Amount, Nexstar agrees to pay WYZZ, within 30 days following each calendar month of the Term, the amount set forth on Exhibit B hereto with respect to such calendar month (c) On or before the 5th day of each calendar month during the Term, Nexstar shall pay to WYZZ the fair market value rent (as set forth on Exhibit C hereto) of any real property owned by WYZZ (or any affiliate thereof) and used by the Stations\\u037e provided, no rent shall be due to WYZZ, Nexstar or any affiliate thereof with respect to any period where the Stations are using corresponding real property owned by Nexstar (or any affiliate thereof). By way of example, no rent shall be due to WYZZ or Nexstar under this clause (c) for use by one of the Stations of a broadcast tower owned by WYZZ if the other Station is using a tower owned by Nexstar. (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term \\\"BCF\\\" is defined as Net Income of the Stations, determined on a basis in accordance with GAAP, plus the sum of (X) (in each case to the extent deducted in calculating Net Income) (i) depreciation expense (ii) amortization expense (including amortization of program assets and amortization of deferred and stock based compensation) (iii) interest expense (iv) corporate overhead or management fees (v) income tax expense (vi) non-cash losses or expenses (including losses on disposals of assets and trade/barter expenses) (vii) Section 2(a) Amount expenses pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof (viii) any expenses (other than 4 electric costs relating to the digital transmission of either Station's primary commercial broadcast signal) related to either Station's \\\"DTV Spectrum\\\" (ix) costs or expenses arising from any claims relating to the period prior to the Effective Date, and (x) any expenses or costs identified on Exhibit D hereto less the sum of (Y) (i) cash payments for program contract rights relating to the Stations (ii) payments made by Nexstar to WYZZ pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 2, to the extent not otherwise taken into account in calculating Net Income, (iii) the aggregate fair market value rent (as set forth on Exhibit C hereto) of any real property owned by either Nexstar or WYZZ (or any affiliate of either) and used by the Stations to the extent the Stations are not using corresponding real property owned by each of the parties hereto (or any affiliate thereof) and which is not otherwise taken into account in calculating Net Income, (iv) any other rental income earned by either WYZZ or Nexstar from real property owned or leased thereby to the extent included in calculating Net Income (v) interest income to the extent included in calculating Net Income (vi) any rent paid with respect to any capital leases of the Stations (vii ) any revenues related to either Station's \\\"DTV Spectrum\\\" and (viii) any non-cash gains or revenues (including gains on disposals of assets and trade/barter revenue). (e) At all times during the Term and for six (6) months following the termination of this Agreement, WYZZ shall have the right, upon prior written request to Nexstar, to review all of the books and records of Nexstar relating to the BCF Report and the Distributions. Any such review must take place during normal business hours between Monday through Friday. (f) The parties agree that, to the extent permitted by law and by the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, the Stations shall be operated in a manner consistent with industry standards for commercial broadcast television stations providing general entertainment programming and with a view toward maximizing the combined broadcast cash flow of the Stations. (g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, with respect to any month, the Section 2(a) Amount is a negative amount, then WYZZ shall pay such negative amount to Nexstar within seventy-five (75) days following the end of such month (and Nexstar shall make no payment of a Section 2(a) Amount to WYZZ with respect to such month)\\u037e provided, with respect to each of the first three (3) months of the Term, the amount if any, payable pursuant to this clause (g) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of accounts receivable retained by Buyer during such month pursuant to the first proviso to the last sentence of Section 10(d)(i). (h) On or prior to the 30th day after WYZZ's receipt of the Final BCF Report, WYZZ may give Nexstar a written notice (an \\\"Objection Notice\\\") indicating its objections to the Final BCF Report. If WYZZ does not give Nexstar an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the Final BCF Report will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. If WYZZ gives a timely Objection Notice, then Nexstar and 5 WYZZ will negotiate in good faith to resolve their disputes regarding the Final BCF Report. If Nexstar and WYZZ are unable to resolve all disputes regarding the Final BCF Report on or prior to the 30th day after the Objection Notice is given, then Nexstar and WYZZ will retain a \\\"big five\\\" accounting firm (either by mutual agreement or by random choice after eliminating any such firm which is conflicted or otherwise unable to participate) (the \\\"Independent Accounting Firm\\\") to resolve the dispute as soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days. The BCF for the applicable year as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and will constitute the BCF for such year for all purposes of this Section 2\\u037e provided, the parties will use reasonable efforts to limit the scope of the Independent Accounting Firm's review. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with its review of the Final BCF Report shall be paid one-half by Nexstar and one-half by WYZZ. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, cash payments for program content rights relating to the Stations which were contractually due prior to the Effective Date shall for all purposes be treated as relating to the period following the Effective Date if, and only if, such payments were ninety days or less past due as of the Effective Date. 3.

Indemnification Procedure. Neither WYZZ nor Nexstar shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section unless such claim for indemnification is asserted in a written notice delivered to the other Party, together with a statement as to the factual basis for the claim and the amount of the claim. Together with such notice or promptly following the delivery thereof, the Party making the claim (the \\\"Claimant\\\") shall make available to the other Party (the \\\"Indemnitor\\\") information relied upon by the 23 Claimant to substantiate the claim. Such notice shall be given promptly following Claimant knowing or having reason to know about such claim\\u037e provided, the Indemnitor shall be relieved of a liability for Claimant's failure to provide notice only if, and to the extent, adversely impacted by such failure. The Indemnitor under this Section 26(c) shall have the right to conduct and control through counsel of its own choosing the defense of any third Party claim, action or suit (and the Claimant shall cooperate fully with the Indemnitor), but the Claimant may, at its election, participate in the defense of any such claim, action or suit at its sole cost and expense\\u037e provided, that, if the Indemnitor shall fail to defend any such claim, action or suit, then the Claimant may defend through counsel of its own choosing such claim, action or suit, and (so long as it gives the Indemnitor at least fifteen (15) days' notice of the terms of the proposed settlement thereof and permits the Indemnitor to then undertake the defense thereof), Claimant may settle such claim, action or suit, and, if Claimant is entitled to be indemnified by Indemnitor hereunder, Claimant may recover from the Indemnitor the amount of such settlement or of any judgment and the costs and expenses of such defense.

Damages\\u037e Specific Performance. a. In the event of a material breach by WYZZ of its obligations hereunder, Nexstar shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against WYZZ. The Parties recognize, however, that, given the unique nature of the Station and this Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Nexstar for any injury resulting from WYZZ's breach. Except to the extent such action would not be permitted by the rules and regulations of the FCC, Nexstar shall therefore be entitled, in addition to a right to seek and collect monetary damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought by Nexstar to enforce this Agreement, WYZZ shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. In addition, in the event of a material breach by WYZZ of its obligations hereunder, Nexstar shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights pursuant to Section 25(b) hereof (except that Nexstar may not assert consequential, special or punitive damages or any claim for lost profits). b. In the event of a material breach by Nexstar of its obligations hereunder, WYZZ shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against Nexstar. The Parties recognize, however, that, given the unique nature of the Station and this Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate WYZZ for any injury resulting from Nexstar's breach. Except to the extent such action would not be permitted by the rules and regulations of the FCC, WYZZ shall therefore be entitled, in addition to a right to seek and collect monetary damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought by WYZZ to enforce this Agreement, Nexstar 24 shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. In addition, in the event of a material breach by Nexstar of its obligations hereunder, WYZZ shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights pursuant to Section 25(a) hereof (except that WYZZ may not assert consequential, special or punitive damages or any claim for lost profits). c. In the event any Party files a lawsuit or institutes other formal legal action to enforce its rights under this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be reimbursed by the other Party for all reasonable expenses incurred thereby, including reasonable attorney's fees.
